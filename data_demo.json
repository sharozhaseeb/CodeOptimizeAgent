The main operations on your code are the comparison and swapping of the array elements which are taking most of the time. But we cannot change the nature of the insertion sort to improve it, as it's already considered a fairly efficient version of insertion sort.\n\n2. You could consider adopting a more efficient sorting algorithm such as quicksort, mergesort, timsort, or heapsort if the size of the array is large. However, changing the algorithm altogether would mean changing the nature of the function itself.\n\n3. Any sort of improvement in the current function would only result in minor time optimizations, as the concept of the algorithm would still remain the same.\n\n4.
