    "content": "The given code has a function that calculates the sum and the product of a list of numbers. The sum is calculated using the built-in function and the product in a for loop. The memory used in all the cases is negligible however the time taken seems to vary with the size of the input.\n\nImprovements and Optimization:\n\n1) Use built-in libraries for product calculation: The time-taken for product calculation is quite high as it is done using a for-loop. This can be optimized by using built-in python libraries like numpy that are faster and efficient. numpy.prod function can be used for this.\n\n2) Use a more efficient way to handle large lists: If the list has large number of elements, using numpy arrays instead of list can make computation more efficient.\n\n3) Using numexpr for large computations: If the calculations are too heavy, instead of numpy libraries, one can use numexpr which is efficient in handling large computations.\n\n4) Using functools reduce for product calculation: The python's functools library's reduce function can be used to calculate the product which can be faster than a simple for loop.\n\nHere is the optimized code incorporating the above suggestions:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\n\ndef do_stuff(numbers):\n    # Convert list to array for faster computation if list is too large\n    numbers = np.array(numbers)\n    \n    s = np.sum(numbers)\n    \n    # Using numpy product function\n    prod = np.prod(numbers)\n    \n    # Alternatively, using reduce for product calculation\n    #prod = reduce(operator.mul, numbers, 1)\n    \n    return s, prod\n```\nPlease note that the time gain will actually be noticeable only when the size of the input list is large."
